  <h3>Our Mission</h3>
  <p>
  The Virtual Stock Portfolio (VSP) system's mission is to provide an introduction to stock market
  trading for beginners.  The virtual system operates similarly to the real stock market, yet it does
  not mimic it perfectly.  The goal is to address the basics of stock market trading -- those features
  used the majority of the time.  Our goal is not to provide a complete stock market trading system 
  that replicates the real world one and provides all of the capabilities; but to help people get their 
  feet wet with the essentials so they will be willing to attempt some trades in the real world.  Our
  goal is not to make experts but provide and introduction to the trading world.</p>
